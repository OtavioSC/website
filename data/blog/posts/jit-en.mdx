summary: Why you should stop trying to learn everything
---

When I first started coding, I often found myself procrastinating by reading
endless articles about a technology I wanted to use instead of building projects
. While I understood the importance o the theory behind Docker, Kafka, and Micro
services,I wasn't making any practical progress, and my motivation was waning. I needed
to find a way to build my side projects without getting bogged down in research
and to stay motivated throughout the process.

The answer is: [Just-in-time learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-tim
e_learning)

In essence, the Just-in-time approach aims to teach you what you need to know
only when it is required, using chunks of content on demand to fill a specific s
lot of knowledge in your mind.

If you have a feature x to create, split it into small pieces and learn only what 
you need to solve that slice of the challenge.

It may seem simple but has to be simple.

Stay focused to create each part of your MVP, side project or whatever are you
building like a complex puzzle. One piece at a time. If you come across a piece 
that you don't understand where it fits, take the time to learn and understand 
it before moving forward.

Learn exactly what you need and don't anticipate problems.
